# What is bit-getter?
`bit-getter` - or just `getbits` (the CLI name) is a small and cute incremental/idle game completely in your terminal!
Get bits, get *useful* bits, or even *extremelly useful* bits! All can be used to update your bit-minning setup!

Maybe someday, you'll find some... *interesting* data about something...

The rough overview on what is planned can be found [here](commands.md)!
